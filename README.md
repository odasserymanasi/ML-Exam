Real Estate Price Prediction

This repository contains the machine learning model for predicting real estate prices. 

Overview
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices, which can help in making informed real estate investment decisions.

Dataset
The dataset includes columns for:

surface: The area of the property in square meters.
rooms_new: The number of rooms in the property.
zipcode_new: The zipcode of the property location.
price_new: The price of the property.
latitude and longitude: Coordinates of the property.

Methodology
The project follows a structured workflow:

Data Collection: Gathering data as per the described schema.
Data Preparation: Handling missing values and preparing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
Model Training: Using KNN Regressor and Multiple Regression models.
Model Evaluation: Comparing models based on RÂ² score, MSE, and RMSE.

Results
The KNN model outperformed the Linear Regression model.
